What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates the .git folder and sets up its initial contents ready to start
	tracking the version history of the repository. You need to do it so that
	the other git commands will be able to begin operating.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area has a transient state that is used as the intermediate
	stage of turning changes within the working directory into commit records
	in the repository.
