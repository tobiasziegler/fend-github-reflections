When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository would obviously be useful when you are going to collaborate with other people on the project, or when
  you just want to share the code so that anyone else can view, download and use it. But it also provides a way to prevent 
  your code being stored only on a single device, which is useful if you work at multiple computers or just if you want to 
  avoid the risk of losing the project if the local files or computer are lost or damaged (although having a broader backup 
  strategy for your local data is important anyway).
